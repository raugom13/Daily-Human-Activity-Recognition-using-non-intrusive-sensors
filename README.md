# Daily-Human-Activity-Recognition-using-non-intrusive-sensors

A prediction model has been developed based on recurrent neural networks, specifically on bidirectional LSTM networks, to obtain in real-time the activity being carried out by the individuals in their homes, based on the information provided by a set of different sensors installed at each personâ€™s home. The prediction model provides a 95.42% accuracy rate, improving the results of similar models currently in use. In order to obtain a reliable model with a high accuracy rate, a series of processing and filtering processes have been carried out on the data, such as a method based on a sliding window or a stacking and re-ordering algorithm, that are subsequently used to train the neural network, obtained from the public database CASAS.

# Setup and demo

- Clone this repo to your local machine using 
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/raugom13/Daily-Human-Activity-Recognition-using-non-intrusive-sensors.git
  ```
  
- Execute this line to convert the raw data into .npy format and split it to test, train and validation.
 ```
 python3 PrepareData.py
  ```
- Execute this line to perform the training of the neural network. In addition, you can select the architecture of the network (biLSTM_H) and store the relevant information of the training into a log file (attempt1.log).
 ```
 python3 Training.py --v biLSTM_H > attempt1.log
  ```
The model has been trained on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-10900K CPU@3.70 GHz / 128 Gb with two RTX3090 GPUs.

# Configuration of PrepareData.py

- It is possible to filter the number of events of the activities to be placed in this part of the code together with the filtering ratio (as a percentage of 1).
 ```
filters = {
    "Other" : 0.05,
    "Sleep" : 0.05
}
  ```
- By modifying this part of the code it is possible to vary the weight of the data distribution in the training, test and validation sets.
```
# Training percentages
validation_percent = 0.1
test_percent = 0.2
```
- By modifying the secondsDIV parameter, the time at which events are sampled can be varied. In the same way, by modifying the dimWINDOW parameter, the size of the sliding window can be varied. Finally, by varying the stack_size parameter, the stack size of consecutive samples can be changed before unordering them.
```
secondsDIV = 60
dimWINDOW = 5
stack_size = 2
```

# Configuration of Training.py
- If the units parameter is modified, the number of cells in the LSTM layer can be changed. On the other hand, if the batch_size parameter is modified, the number of samples that the program takes together to train the neural network can be varied. If the epochs parameter is modified, the number of times the program takes the totality of the data to train the neural network is changed. Finally, the parameter DIMENSION is used to indicate to the program the number of components contained in a line of data (depending on the window size).
```
# Important parameters
units = 64
batch_size = 256
epochs = 50
DIMENSION = 5*33 + 2 # Data dimension (60 min * 33 sensors + 2 hours)
```
